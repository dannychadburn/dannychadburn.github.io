# Small is beautiful

> Headlines, taglines, straplines, subject lines, bylines - the only thing I can't help you out with is your waistline.

And the best thing? I'll always meet your deadlines.

## Brevity is an artform

With 15 years of experience crafting copy for every conceivable digital channel, I've honed my talents to be able to condense any content, company or campaign into a succinct snippet.

Using the space allotted, I specialise in making every character count, whether that's within two words or 20.

- Looking to improve landing page conversion?
- Seeking better search rankings for your products?
- Want to increase email open rates?
- Hoping your ad campaign gets noticed?

## In perfect harmony

I work with companies redeveloping their brand voice, pushing out new product ranges or launching a marketing campaign. Copy is pivotal in the success of any of these ventures, and others.

Every project is unique, but four weeks is usually enough time to properly research your market, get to know your business, work through the various options, then produce an output that will hit the mark with your audience.

The first part of the process is to [arrange a coffee](/contact) so we can discuss your project.

## Guided by SEO, but never blinded by it

Google is a clever little fella; certainly a lot more intelligent than it used to be. With semantic search, cramming keywords into your page titles and H1 tags is no longer a necessity, and most SEO experts I talk to actively warn against.

That means much more flexibility in what to write to attract attention. I still pay heed to search best practices, stretching the boundaries of creativity to make sure it resonates with people as well as crawlers.
