	<p class="intro">Headlines, taglines, straplines, subject lines, bylines - the only thing I can't help you out with is your waistline.</p>
	<p>And the best thing? I always meet your deadline.</p>
	<h2>Brevity is an artform</h2>
    <p>With 15 years of experience crafting copy for every conceivable digital channel, I've honed my talents to be able to condense any content, company or campaign into a succinct snippet.</p>
   <p>Using the space allotted, I specialise in making every character count, whether that's within two words or 20.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Looking to improve conversion on your landing pages?</li>
  		<li>Seeking better search rankings for your products?</li>
  		<li>Want to increase email open rates?</li>
  		<li>Hoping to kick off your ad campaign with a bang?</li>
  	</ul>

  <h2>In perfect harmony</h2>
  <p>I work with companies redeveloping their brand voice, pushing out a new product range or launching a marketing campaign. Copy is has a pivotal part to play in the success of any of these ventures.</p>
  <p>Every project is unique, but four weeks is usually enough time to properly research your market, get to know your business, work through the various options, then produce an output that will hit the mark with your audience.</p>
  <blockquote><strong>Need something in a hurry?</strong> Check out my <a href="#">Copy Right Now</a> service, which offers 24h, 72h or 1 week options (depending on how desperate you are).</blockquote>
  <h2>Guided by SEO, but never blinded by it</h2>
  <p>Google is a clever little fella; certainly a lot more intelligent than it used to be. With semantic search, cramming keywords into your page titles and H1 tags is no longer a necessity, and most SEO experts I talk to actively warn against.</p>
  <p>That means much more flexibility in what to write to attract attention. I still pay heed to search best practices, stretching the boundaries of creativity to make sure it resonates with people as well as crawlers.</p>
