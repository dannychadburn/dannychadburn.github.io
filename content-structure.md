# Strategy is important, but not as important as structure

> Conetnt strategy as a concept is good, but there's a low barrier to entry. Anyone can be a content strategist, but very few can explain what they actually do.

This is about practical output!

## Be organised

Content audits, IA development, CMS migrations and domain consolidations..

With a career spanning journalism, IA, SEO, UX and social media I'm perfectly adept at slotting into wherever the gap in your team lies.

There's a lot to factor in when adapting your existing content setup. URL structures, SEO metadata, CMS workflows and custom event tracking, are some of the many things considered when devising a content migration checklist.
