# Content that's built to last

#### Forget the elaborate mind maps and intricate venn diagrams - I offer a practical solution to delivering better digital content.

My ability to define and deliver exceptional **Information Architecture** for clients stems from my experience in the world of content strategy, plus a bit of inherited knowledge from the SEO and UX experts I've been lucky enough to work with.

I can make sure your audience knows what content you have to offer, and help them to find it.

## Get organised

There's a lot to factor in when adapting your existing content setup. URL structures, SEO-friendly redirects, metadata, CMS workflows and event tracking - it's no wonder content migration projects have a habit of dragging on ad infinitum.

I pride myself on the efficiency of my approach. Your IA can be redeveloped in under 12 weeks, with all the necessary audits, migration checklist and domain consolidations.

It's as meticulous as you'll get from any other agency or freelancer, but you won't still be paying me this time next year.
