# Content that's built to last

#### Forget the elaborate mind maps and intricate venn diagrams - I offer a practical solution to delivering better digital content.

My ability to define and deliver exceptional Information Architecture stems from my vast experience in content strategy, combined with a bit of inherited knowledge from the SEO and UX experts I've been lucky enough to work with.

I can make sure your audience knows what content you have to offer, and help them to find it.

## Get organised

There's a lot to factor in when adapting your existing content setup. Hierarchies, structures, redirects, metadata, [microcopy](/headline-copy), workflows and tracking - it's no wonder content migration and domain consolidation projects have a habit of dragging on ad infinitum.

I pride myself on the efficiency of my approach. Your IA can be revolutionised in as little as 12 weeks, with all the necessary audits, plans, frameworks, roadmaps and checklists delivered on time, and within budget.

It's as meticulous as you'll get from any other agency or freelancer, but you won't still be paying me this time next year.

## Guiding big websites through complex projects

From both in-house and agency side, the many industries I've worked across include automotive, telecoms, healthcare, charity, finance, gaming and recruitment.

[Contact me](/contact). if you'd like to hear more about how I have:

- Recategorised over 5,000 reference pages for a site attracting 1 million visits a day
- Managed the transition to a new CMS, guiding teams in Boston, London, Berlin and Hyderabad through the process
- Merged six distintive microsites under a single umbrella brand domain
- Created a wiki that reflected real-world scenarios for a global network of content creators

By employing my expertise on a short-term basis, I can solve your content challenges at a rapid pace, without you being tied down with too many senior-level staff or expensive agencies who'll put most of your budget into account management.

> If your after more of a one-off burst of attention, I also offer [creative content campaign planning](/creative-content-campaigns) services.
