# Inspire the future stars of your business

#### An organisation's content operation in often built from the ground up, with junior employees shaping what's produced and how it's promoted.

The truth is, they're probably doing a pretty good job; it's a new industry with a skillset perfect for those bristling with youthful enthusiasm and fresh ideas. Recruiting a strategic leader on a hefty salary to oversee them offers questionable value when you look at the raw ROI.

But everyone can benefit from a bit of experience. I offer a mentoring service for those working on the practical content. Whether that's managing editorial production, running social media channels or executing PR campaigns, I've a wealth of knowledge to pass on that will help them reach their potential. 

#### Does that sound like something one of your team could benefit from?

## Getting personal

Having built and led content teams of up to 25 people, I've developed a knack for meeting people on their particular level.

Mentoring can be delivered in two ways:

- **1:1 Sessions** - An informal monthly chat giving your content 
- **Group Mentoring** - For between two and five individuals.

If you have a requirement that sits outside of [Give me a call](/contact) and we can discuss how I can help.
