# Let me lead your next project

#### Available from January 2019

My previous job titles include Product Owner, Head of Content, Content Strategist, but that's covers a tiny selection of roles I've successfully taken on both in-house and agency-side.

Whether you're developing a feature-rich digital product, undertaking a site migration that needs meticulous management, or run a sprawling website that needs an overhaul, take a look at the successes I've had throughout my career.
