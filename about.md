# Everything you ever wanted to know about me

<a href="#facts">Facts</a> / <a href="#faq">FAQ</a> / <a href="#why">Why Tidy Swan?</a>

#### Through creative content development I've generated billions of page views for household name companies, digital marketing agencies, government-funded charities and fledgling startups.

It seemed unfair to limit all that experience to just one employer. So I'm now a freelance consultant offering [IA](/content-information-architecture), [performance analysis](/content-campaign-analytics) and [content marketing](/creative-content-marketing) services to companies of all shapes and sizes.

I was once described by a manager as a maverick. It may or may not have been intended as a compliment, but I took it as one. My approach is unconventional - an invaluable trait when the industry often accepts homogeneity and the humdrum.

## FAQ

#### Do you have a portfolio?
Yes.

#### Can I see it?
Yes, but only if I can [talk you through it](/contact). Viewing work examples online is like buying shoes or browsing properties - you don't know if they're for you until you see them in the flesh.

You won't be faced with a heavy sales pitch, I'd just prefer to show you things in context rather than some fabricated examples.

#### Do you specialise in a particular industry?
No. I have a penchant for technology and sport, but I've plied my trade in pretty much every market from agriculture to zoology.

#### What's your day rate?
Â£400 a day, but could be higher or lower depending on the nature of each project.

#### Do you work pro-bono?
I have done and would do again for the right cause. [Send me a pitch](/contact)!

#### Do you know an expert in branding, design, SEO, UX, etc?
Probably! [Give me a shout](/contact) and I'll try and hook you up with a talented individual.

#### Will you work in my city/country?
Sure, if you'll cover the travel costs (don't worry, I'm happy in standard class). Just to warn you, English is my sole language.

## Why Tidy Swan?

When I took the freelance leap, I opted for a trading name after growing tired of phonetically spelling C-H-A-D-B-U-R-N for the past few decades.

So I mashed together a list of two-syllable adjectives with various animals that rhyme with .com, then ran them through a domain name checker.

[tidyswan.com](/index) jumped out of the pack, with the added benefit of _'tidy'_ being slang for _'good'_ in my birthplace of Wales.
