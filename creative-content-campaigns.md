# Thinking outside the dodecahedron

> There's such thing as a template for perfect content campaign. If there was, industry would be a pretty dull place.

So while there is a basic process I follow (planning, production, promotion), every campaign I craft is as individual as the companies I've created them for.

## A conveyor belt of creativity

Blend best of marketing, SEO, PR, social media and some new technology, find an audience hook then crack on.

All backed up by [data](/content-data-models).

## A bit of namedropping

Campaigns I've crafted have appeared in these places, without a penny changing hands.

### And some accolades

Won some awards too (although take these pince of salt) - personal fave, different awards.
