# Small is beautiful

#### I write headlines, taglines, straplines, subject lines, bylines - the only thing I can't help you out with is your waistline.

And the best thing? I'll always meet your deadline.

## Brevity is an artform

Having crafted copy for every conceivable digital channel, I've honed my talents to be able to condense any content, company mission or campaign into a succinct snippet.

I make every character count, within two words or 20.

- Looking to improve landing page conversion?
- Seeking better search rankings for your products?
- Want to increase email open rates?
- Hoping your marketing campaign gets noticed?

## In perfect harmony

Copy is pivotal to the success of many marketing activities. I work with companies redeveloping their brand voice, launchiung new products and running marketing campaigns. 

Every project is unique, but four weeks is usually enough time to research your market, get to know your business, work through the various options, then produce an output that hits the mark.

The first part of the process is to [arrange a coffee](/contact) so we can discuss your project.

## Guided by SEO, but never blinded by it

With advances in semantic search, cramming multiple keywords into your page titles and meta tags is no longer a necessity. It's a practice most SEO experts I talk to actively warn against.

#### That means much more flexibility in what to write to attract attention.

I still pay heed to search best practices, but stretch the boundaries of creativity to make sure copy resonates with people, as well as crawlers.
