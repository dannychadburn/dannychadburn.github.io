# Small is beautiful

#### I write headlines, taglines, straplines, subject lines, bylines - the only thing I can't help you out with is your waistline.

And the best thing? I'll always meet your deadline.

## Brevity is an artform

Having crafted copy for every conceivable digital channel, I've honed my talents to be able to condense any content, company or campaign into a succinct snippet.

I making every character count, whether that's within two words or 20.

- Looking to improve landing page conversion?
- Seeking better search rankings for your products?
- Want to increase email open rates?
- Hoping your marketing campaign gets noticed?

## In perfect harmony

I work with companies redeveloping their brand voice, pushing out new product ranges or launching marketing campaigns. Copy is pivotal to the success of any of these ventures.

Every project is unique, but four weeks is usually enough time to research your market, get to know your business, work through the various options, then produce an output that will hit the mark.

The first part of the process is to [arrange a coffee](/contact) so we can discuss your project.

### Guided by SEO, but never blinded by it

With advances in semantic search, cramming multiple keywords into your page titles and H1 tags is no longer a necessity. It's a practice most SEO experts I talk to actively warn against.

That means much more flexibility in what to write to attract attention. I still pay heed to search best practices, stretching the boundaries of creativity to make sure it resonates with people as well as crawlers.
