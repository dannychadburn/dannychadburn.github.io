# Put your ideas in your customers' hands

#### Your biggest lead generator is waiting to be written

All companies want to be seen as pioneers in their industry; the ones who are innovating, pushing boundaries and setting the standards to which others aspire.

That presence  comes from sharing the knowledge and experience of intelligent and inspirational people, and eBooks are an efficient and proven way of spreading the word to the right audiences. However, the individuals within your company with the most interesting stories to tell are invariably those with the least available time to do so.

It's often a struggle to turn their valuable experiences, opinions and ideas into a simple blog post, let alone something more substantial.

#### It's time to realise this missed opportunity, show off your expertise and have new customers lining up at your door

I produce engaining and powerful eBooks, extracting key infomration from your senior team and topic specialists. Using an [agile development](/contracting-cv/) process, your shiny new eBook can be ready in just 4-6 weeks,

Every project is unique, from startups wanting a 7,000 word booklet to multinationals putting together a 70,000 word advanced guide. I've tackled both ends of that spectrum, and will produce and publish an asset that resonates with the market, giving you the results you're looking for.

The usual process consists of six stages:

---
### 1 - Specification Consultation
_1-2 hours_

During an informal chat over a coffee, we'll ensure you have a viable book project. The discussion will cover a few outline concepts, the logistics of what it'll take to create the book, what else is already out there on the topic, and what a successful result would look like.

I'll also dig into search and social trends to see what topics people are looking for, and how likely it is your book will get the attention it deserves.

**This kickoff is 100% free - [get in touch now](/contact) to arrange a meeting.**

---
### 2 - Storyboarding
_1-2 days_

Your book can start from anything. If you have some old presentation slides or a few scribbled notes, that's enough to get going. Every good book (both fiction and non-fiction) has a stong story arc, so we'll get out a few Sharpies and Post-Its and map out exactly what the beginning, middle and end looks like.

We'll flesh out the original idea, breaking down the narrative so each chapter builds into a real page-turner. Even if someone doesn't make it the whole way through your book in one sitting, there will be a series of strong messages scattered throughout.

You'll be given a blueprint of 10-15 pages to share with your colleages, with a sign-off milestone to take us into the core developemnt phase.

---
### 3 - Interviews
_4-6 hours_

The best way to get ideas out of your head and onto paper is to talk them through. I'll conduct a series of individual interviews (either in person or over the phone) with all the people who need to contribute to your book, recording the conversations to later convert into a mmanuscript.

With extensibve editorial experience, I'm a seasoned interviewer adept at extracting the necessary info from even the most guarded of interviewees.

Depending on the complexity of each topic, this may consist of several conversations. My background covers a variety of digital marketing disciplines, so can get to grips with any topic with ease. I can be as flexible as required to fit around busy and unpredictable schedules.

---
### 4 - Editing
_2-3 weeks_

With the interview transcripts down on tape, I'll craft the bulk of your book following the agreed storybopard. We'll have discussed and agreed the appropriate tone to adopt so it reflects your business, and is pitched at the right level for the intended audience.

This is usually the most time-intensive part of the process, however there will be regular communication throughout with draft chapters supplied as collaborative documents for live review and comment.

---
### 5 - Publishing
_3-4 days_

Once a final sign-off has been provided on the copy, we'll add a bit of polish and start promoting your book!

I'll work with design professionals (either from within your company or one of my trusted contacts) to create a beautiful cover and promotional images that reflect your brand guidelines. The resulting assets will integrate neatly into your site, and be optimised for use on eBook stores and various social networks.

You'll retain all rights and ownership of the book and I will coordinate various publishing details (ISBN, metadata, etc) so it's set up for Amazon Kindle, Apple iBooks, Nook, Kobo, Google Play and mony other digital libraries.

#### The exported file will be provided in various eBook formats:

- **.epub** - the most widely used ebook format, allowing custoemrs to absorb your book wherever and whenever they desire.
- **.mobi** - specifically for the Amazon store and Kindle devices - a massive potential audience.
- **.pdf** - the standard in digital publishing that will work neatly on laptops, desktops or print.

Printing services are also available on request should you wish for your book to take a physical form.

### 6 - Distribution, Promotion and Analysis
_1-2 days_

The most important part of your eBook (even more essential than the words) is how people find it. I'll work with your developers to create and optimise a landing page, including a mechanism that will generate the customer information you're looking to obtain.

#### To help your book get the attention it deserves, I offer various promotional options:
- Advance copies sent to industry influencers, with their feedback quotes used for promotion
- A full press kit created for your book launch, including a distribution list of key contacts
- Arranging a podcast interview on you and your book
- Eyecatching social media copy and graphics designed to the specs of each channel
- Articles and blog posts created for your site and various industry news media

With experience in [performance analytics](/consultancy/performance-analytics/), I know how to set things up to track the exact value of every visit from the first click all the way to conversion. You'll get an interactive dashboard mapping out each customer acquisition channel in detail, and if you've decided to sell your book rather than share it for free, you'll get live access to an earnings report broken down by distributor.

#### This isn't just an eBook - it's a powerful marketing tool with a clear ROI

## Keen to know more?

As the scope of each project varies so widely, putting a set price on it is difficult without first talking things through. As a rough guide, a £4,000-£7,000 budget would cover much of what I've outlined above.

Whether you just have the seed of an idea, or a fully formed ebook structure that needs finishing, give me a call and we'll take it from there.
