# Your biggest lead generator is waiting to be written

#### Business books show off what you know, and tempt people into wanting to find out more.

Invariably, the people in your company who would be most suited to writing a book are the ones with the least available time to do so. Their valuable experiences, opinions and ideas are realistically a long way from being published, which represents a huge missed opportunity ion attracting potential customers.

#### That's where I come in.

Every ebook project is unique, from startups wanting a 7,000 word booklet to multinationals putting together a 70,000 word advanced guide. I've tacked both ends of that spectrum and know exactly how to produce and publish something that will resonate with your audience.

I follow a flexible 6 stage process that will get your shiny new eBook out the door, and have potential new customers coming knocking.

---
## 1 - Specification Consultation

We make sure you have a viable book and what it will take to create it. This will involve an in-depth conversation covering bothe the concept, and the desired results.

---
## 2 - Storyboarding

Your book can start from anything. If you have presentation slides or some scribbled notes, that's enough to get going. Every good book (both fictioon and non-fiction) has a stong story arc, so we'll map out exactly what the beginning, middle and end looks like.

We'll flesh out the original idea, and determine the specific messages and inputs required to complete each chapter, and create a real page-turner. This will consist of approximately 10 to 20 pages, and provide the blueprint from which the ebook takes shape.

---
## 3 - Interviews

The best way to get your ideas and expertise out of your head and onto paper is to talk them through. I'll conduct detailed interviews either in person or over the phone with all the people who need to contribute to your book, recording the conversations to later convert into the mmanuscript. With extensibve editorial expertise, I'm a seasoned interviewer adept at extracting the necessary info from evemn the most guarded of interviewees.

Depending on the detail of each topic, this may consist of a couple or several conversations. My background covers a variety of digital marketing disciplines, so can get to grips with any topic with ease. I'm happy to be as flexible as required to fit around busy and unpredictable schedules.

Most importantly, they all have three traits in common: they’re great interviewers, they’re great writers, and they care deeply about books.

## 4 - Editing

The interview transcripts will be converted into a narrative following the agreed storybopard. I'll adopt a tone that represents your business perfectly, pulling together all the different views and opinions into a cohesive prose.

This is usually the most tim-intensive part of the process, however there will be regular communication throughout with draft chapters supplied as collaborative documents for live review and comment.

---
## 5 - Publishing

And once the writing is complete, we can progress to the design and promote your book.

I'll work with a design professional (either at your company or one I sourse) to create a beautiful cover and help typesetting for your book using your brand guidelines. The resulting assets will slot neatly into your site, and be optimised for use on eBook stores and social media.

The team will also work with you to determine your distribution goals and retail channels—whether you want to be exclusively on Amazon or available on as many international platforms as possible, they will provide the best options for you, handle all account and file creation, and upload your book in preparation of your launch.
