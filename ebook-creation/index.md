# Your biggest lead generator is waiting to be written

#### Show off your expertise and have new customers lining up at your door

All companies want to be seen as leaders in their industry; the ones who are innovating, pushing boundaries and setting the standards to which others aspire.

That comes from sharing the knowledge and experience of intelligent and inspirational people, and eBooks have proven an efficient and effective way of spreading the word to the right audience. However, the individuals within your company with the most interesting stories to tell are invariably those with the least available time to do so.

It's often a struggle to turn their valuable experiences, opinions and ideas into a blog post, let alonge something more substantial.

#### I'll help you realise this missed opportunity

Every ebook project is unique, from startups wanting a 7,000 word booklet to multinationals putting together a 70,000 word advanced guide. I've tacked both ends of that spectrum and know exactly how to produce and publish something that will resonate, and give you the results you're looking for.

Using an agile development process, your shiny new eBook can be ready to go within 4-6 weeks,

### 1 - Specification Consultation
_1-2 hours_

We make sure you have a viable book and what it will take to create it. This will involve an in-depth conversation covering bothe the concept, and the desired results.

---
### 2 - Storyboarding
_1-2 days_

Your book can start from anything. If you have presentation slides or some scribbled notes, that's enough to get going. Every good book (both fictioon and non-fiction) has a stong story arc, so we'll map out exactly what the beginning, middle and end looks like.

We'll flesh out the original idea, and determine the specific messages and inputs required to complete each chapter, and create a real page-turner. This will consist of approximately 10 to 20 pages, and provide the blueprint from which the ebook takes shape.

---
### 3 - Interviews
_4-6 hours_

The best way to get your ideas and expertise out of your head and onto paper is to talk them through. I'll conduct detailed interviews either in person or over the phone with all the people who need to contribute to your book, recording the conversations to later convert into the mmanuscript. With extensibve editorial expertise, I'm a seasoned interviewer adept at extracting the necessary info from evemn the most guarded of interviewees.

Depending on the detail of each topic, this may consist of a couple or several conversations. My background covers a variety of digital marketing disciplines, so can get to grips with any topic with ease. I'm happy to be as flexible as required to fit around busy and unpredictable schedules.

Most importantly, they all have three traits in common: they’re great interviewers, they’re great writers, and they care deeply about books.

### 4 - Editing
_2-3 weeks_

The interview transcripts will be converted into a narrative following the agreed storybopard. I'll adopt a tone that represents your business perfectly, pulling together all the different views and opinions into a cohesive prose.

This is usually the most tim-intensive part of the process, however there will be regular communication throughout with draft chapters supplied as collaborative documents for live review and comment.

---
### 5 - Publishing
_3-4 days_

And once the writing is complete, we can progress to the design and promote your book.

I'll work with a design professional (either at your company or one I sourse) to create a beautiful cover and help typesetting for your book using your brand guidelines. The resulting assets will slot neatly into your site, and be optimised for use on eBook stores and social media.

The team will also work with you to determine your distribution goals and retail channels—whether you want to be exclusively on Amazon or available on as many international platforms as possible, they will provide the best options for you, handle all account and file creation, and upload your book in preparation of your launch.

## Keen to know more?

As the scope of each eBook project varies so widely, putting a set price on it is difficult without first talking things through. As a rough guide, a budget of around £4-7,000 would cover the scope of the process outlines above.

Whether you just have the seed of an idea, or a fully formed ebook structure, give me a call and we'll take it from there.
