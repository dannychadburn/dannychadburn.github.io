# Your biggest lead generator is waiting to be written

#### Business books show off what you know, and tempt them into wanting to find out more.

Invariably, the people in your company who would be most suited to writing a book are the ones with the least available time to do so. Their valuable experiences, opinions and ideas are realistically a long way from being published, which represents a huge missed opportunity ion attracting potential customers.

#### That's where I com in.

Every ghost writing project is unique, from startups wanting a 7,000 word booklet to multinationals putting together a 70,000 word advanced guide.

While social media has brought about the age of charachter-limited copy, there's been a rejuvinated market for longform content too with eReaders, audiobooks and read-it-later apps.

I follow a flexible 6 stage process that will get your shiny new eBook out the door in approximately 6-8 weeks.

## 1 - Specification Consultation

Your book will be your ideas, words and voice. We believe in your book idea.
Your book will have a marketing plan. Your book will have a path to ROI.

The first step, before you begin, is to make sure you have a book in you and whether or not it makes sense to write it. Note that this is not a sales call, we cannot work with everyone who applies, so this call is about determining whether or not we should work together.

The next step of the process starts with what we call “The North Star” document. Your Publisher (who is your point of contact and guide through the process) will have an in-depth conversation with you and help you define the parameters of your book. In that conversation, you and the Publisher will:

Clearly articulate what your book is about, define exactly who your audience is, understand precisely why that audience will care about your book, specifically outline how you will use the book to benefit you.

Your book can start from anything. If you have presentation slides or some scribbled notes, that's enough to get going.

## 2 - Storyboarding

Once the North Star Document is done, your Publisher will select an Outliner. Our Outliners have backgrounds that range from ex-Executive Editors of major publishing houses, to high-ranking political speechwriters, to Editors-in-Chief of national magazines.

These skills may seem unrelated, but the core is the same: our Outliners deeply understand how to craft story, narrative, and structure, and how to turn good ideas into well structured books.

You will do four calls with your Outliner. First, you will go over your North Star Document again to make sure it is correct and exactly what you want. Then your Outliner will create a rough skeleton outline of your book, almost like a Table of Contents.

From there, your Outliner will help you flesh out your ideas and determine the specific points, stories, and examples you’ll use within each chapter to share your wisdom with the reader. Sample questions to expect:

Q. What does your audience need to understand?

Q. Are there steps to get them there? Is there a logical argument?

Q. What stories and examples do you have to support your points?

By your fourth call, your outline will be 10 to 20 pages, and you’ll work with your Outliner to make sure everything is 100% in line with what you want in your book. Once you are happy with it, you’ll lock the outline, and we’ll move to the next stage.

Note: It’s crucial to the process that we take the necessary time to ensure the outline is accurate and lock it in before moving to the next phase. To use a building analogy, we don’t want to start construction with an inaccurate or half-done blueprint.

We are happy to extend this phase to make sure this happens, so don’t be afraid to speak up if things don’t feel quite right.

## 3 - Interviews

Comprehensive interviews to get all your ideas out of your head and into a book that is in your words and your voice

After you’ve locked in your outline, the next step is your interview calls. Your Publisher will assign you a Scribe (which is sort of like an Editor).

Your Scribe will spend 4-5 calls interviewing you to get everything you know about the subject of your book out of your head and into a recording. This is the information that they need to turn your conversations into a finished draft of your manuscript.

How do you choose my Scribe?

Every Scribe has a long and extensive writing background. They range in experience from Emmy winning writers, to bestselling authors, to high-level journalists, to Fulbright scholars and Pulitzer Prize-winning writers.

Most importantly, they all have three traits in common: they’re great interviewers, they’re great writers, and they care deeply about books.

When pairing Scribes with Authors, we look at three variables:

Q. Are they interested in or have experience with the topic of the book? Q. Will they be able to connect with the author and the material? Q. Are they excited to work with the author?

How does interviewing work?
The interview calls are exactly what they sound like: your Scribe will get on the phone with you for 90 to 120 minutes and interview you about a section of your outline. This usually happens over the course of about 4 to 6 calls total.

They’ll ask the necessary questions, and have you explain each of the ideas in the book (following the outline structure). They’ll ask follow up questions when necessary to get enough information out of you.

## 4 - Editing

The Scribe records all of those calls, and then works from transcripts of your interviews to translate your spoken language into a beautifully written manuscript that will resonate with your audience.

But before they write the book, they will first write a chapter and go over it with you to make sure the voice feels right. Once they nail your voice correctly, they will finish the rest of the manuscript.

From there, you will do one full round of revisions. This usually entails you reading 2 chapters, making notes, and doing a call with your Scribe to go over the revisions. Collaborative doc with full revision history so you can keep track on development

## 5 - Publishing

Our Publishing Team will design a professional cover and interior for your book. The results will make your book completely at home on a shelf next to any traditionally published book.

The team will also work with you to determine your distribution goals and retail channels—whether you want to be exclusively on Amazon or available on as many international platforms as possible, they will provide the best options for you, handle all account and file creation, and upload your book in preparation of your launch.

As well as covering the writing, we help design and promote your book, working with specialist digital publishers.
