# Put your ideas in your customers' hands

#### Your biggest lead generator is waiting to be written

All companies want to be seen as pioneers in their industry; the ones who are innovating, pushing boundaries and setting the standards to which others aspire.

That comes from sharing the knowledge and experience of intelligent and inspirational people, and eBooks have proven an efficient and effective way of spreading the word to the right audiences. However, the individuals within your company with the most interesting stories to tell are invariably those with the least available time to do so.

It's often a struggle to turn their valuable experiences, opinions and ideas into a simple blog post, let alone something more substantial.

#### It's time to realise this missed opportunity, show off your expertise and have new customers lining up at your door

I produce engaining and powerful eBooks, extracting key infomration from your senior team and topic specialists. Using an [agile development](/contracting-cv/) process, your shiny new eBook can be ready in just 4-6 weeks,

Every project is unique, from startups wanting a 7,000 word booklet to multinationals putting together a 70,000 word advanced guide. I've tackled both ends of that spectrum, and will produce and publish an asset that resonates with the market, giving you the results you're looking for.

The usual process consists of six stages:

---
### 1 - Specification Consultation
_1-2 hours_

During an informal chat over a coffee, we'll ensure you have a viable book project. The discussion will cover a few outline concepts, the logistics of what it'll take to create the book, what else is already out there on the topic, and what a successful result would look like.

I'll also dig into search and social trends to see what topics people are looking for, and how likely it is your book will get the attention it deserves.

**This kickoff is 100% free - [get in touch now](/contact) to arrange a meeting.**

---
### 2 - Storyboarding
_1-2 days_

Your book can start from anything. If you have some old presentation slides or a few scribbled notes, that's enough to get going. Every good book (both fiction and non-fiction) has a stong story arc, so we'll get out a few Sharpies and Post-Its and map out exactly what the beginning, middle and end looks like.

We'll flesh out the original idea, breaking down the narrative so each chapter builds into a real page-turner. Even if someone doesn't make it the whole way through your book in one sitting, there will be a series of strong messages scattered throughout.

You'll be given a blueprint of 10-15 pages to share with your colleages, with a sign-off milestone to take us into the core developemnt phase.

---
### 3 - Interviews
_4-6 hours_

The best way to get ideas out of your head and onto paper is to talk them through. I'll conduct a series of individual interviews (either in person or over the phone) with all the people who need to contribute to your book, recording the conversations to later convert into a mmanuscript.

With extensibve editorial experience, I'm a seasoned interviewer adept at extracting the necessary info from even the most guarded of interviewees.

Depending on the complexity of each topic, this may consist of several conversations. My background covers a variety of digital marketing disciplines, so can get to grips with any topic with ease. I can be as flexible as required to fit around busy and unpredictable schedules.

---
### 4 - Editing
_2-3 weeks_

With the interview transcripts down on tape, I'll craft the bulk of your book following the agreed storybopard. We'll have discussed and agreed the appropriate tone to adopt so it reflects your business, and is pitched at the right level for the intended audience.

This is usually the most time-intensive part of the process, however there will be regular communication throughout with draft chapters supplied as collaborative documents for live review and comment.

---
### 5 - Publishing
_3-4 days_

Once a final sign-off has been provided on the copy, we'll add a bit of polish and start promoting your book!

I'll work with design professionals (either from within your company or someone I'd source) to create a beautiful cover and promotional assets that reflect your brand guidelines. The resulting assets will integrate neatly into your site, and be optimised for use on eBook stores and various social media.

You'll retain all rights and ownership of the book and I will coordinate various publishing details (ISBN, typesetting, etc) so it's well optimised for Amazon Kindle, Apple iBooks, Nook, Kobo, Google Play and mony other digital book stores.

#### The exported file will be provided in two eBook formats:

- **.epub** - used by Kindle, iBooks and Google Play Books, so your custoemrs can absorb your book wherever and whenever they desire.
- **.pdf** - the standard in digital publishing that will work neatly on laptops, desktops or print

Printing services are also available on request should you wish for your book to take a physical form.

### 6 - Distribution, Promotion and Analysis
_1-2 days_

The most important part of your eBook (even more essential than the words) is how people find it. I will help you create and optimise a landing page, with a mechanism that will generate the customer information you're looking to obtain.

With experience in [performance analytics](/consultancy/performance-analytics/), I know how to set things up to track the exact value of every visit from first inetraction all the way to conversion, so you can get a true ROI.

#### Optional Pre Launch Promotions
- Advance copies sent to likely interested readers - quotes aquired for promotion
- A full press kit for your book with keyt distribution list
- A full set of social media posts and graphics based on teh book cover
- A scheduled podcast interview on you and your book?
- Blog posts created for your site and an industry new site

## Keen to know more?

As the scope of each eBook project varies so widely, putting a set price on it is difficult without first talking things through. As a rough guide, a budget of around Â£4-7,000 would cover the scope of the process outlines above.

Whether you just have the seed of an idea, or a fully formed ebook structure, give me a call and we'll take it from there.
