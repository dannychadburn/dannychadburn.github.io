# Taking exception to the norm

#### There's no such thing as a template for a perfect content marketing campaign. If there was, the industry (and the internet) would be a pretty dull place.

So while there is a basic process I follow (plan, produce, publish, promote), every campaign I craft is as individual as the <a href="#clients">companies I create them for</a>.

## A conveyor belt of creativity

I'd be lying if I said everything I've ever worked on has been a runaway success, however I do have an impressive hit rate of getting it right.

That's because I blend the best of content, marketing, SEO, PR, social media and innovative new technology to deliver something the audience can latch onto. Whatever your product, whatever your industry, whoever you customer, I'll find the right hook to deliver on your objectives.

And most importantly, I make sure [data](/content-campaign-analytics) is considered at every stage. You'll never be sat thinking _"But what about the ROI?"_ once the coverage dust has settled.

## Some shameless namedropping

A wall of logos is pointless without something to back it up. You'll be pleased to hear I've got interesting stories to tell (and impressive stats to share) about each of the branded campaigns listed below (and tonnes more).

- **Rolls Royce** x Daily Telegraph / Time Out
- **Adam & Eve** x Buzzfeed / SPORTbible
- **Patient** x Fansided / New York Post
- **LG** x Londonist / Evening Standard
- **Gala Bingo** x The Argus / Visit Exmoor
- **Blaze** x The Guardian

#### Each of these has been achieved without a penny in media fees changing hands.

This isn't a case of paying big bucks for native advertising, it's about crafting a narrative and putting your business in the right context.

### Hits from the gong

While we all know industry awards are dished out to whoever pays most for a table, it's always nice to get an accolade for your efforts.

I've been lucky enough to quaff Champagne at various events, including my personal favourite the **#DoDifferent Awards** which is _"...for those who dare to step outside the confining comfort of conventionality and do something brilliantly new."_
