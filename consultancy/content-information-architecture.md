# Content that's built to last

#### Forget the over-elaborate mind maps and intricate venn diagrams. I offer practical solutions to improving content structure.

Drawing on experience from content strategy, SEO and UX I'll apply the right IA model to your content. The goal is to make it easier for people to discover what you have to offer, and lead them towards your most lucrative pages.

## Get organised

There's a lot to factor in when adapting your existing content setup. Hierarchies, structural models, redirects, metadata, microcopy, workflows and tracking. It's no wonder content migration and domain consolidation projects have a habit of dragging on forever.

My approach is efficient. You can have a brand new IA in as little as 12 weeks. All the necessary audits, plans, frameworks, roadmaps and checklists get delivered on time, and within budget.

#### It's as meticulous as you'll get from any agency, but you won't still be paying me this time next year.

Does that sound like something your business needs?
