# Inspire the future stars of your business

#### An organisation's content operation in often built from the ground up, with junior employees shaping what's produced and how it's promoted.

The reality is, they're probably doing a pretty good job; it's a new industry suited to those bristling with youthful enthusiasm and fresh ideas. Recruiting a strategic leader on a hefty salary to oversee them offers questionable value.

#### But everyone can benefit from a bit of guidance.

I offer a mentoring service for those working on the practical side of content. Whether that's managing editorial production, running social media channels or executing PR campaigns, I have a wealth of knowledge to pass on that will help them reach their potential. 

#### Does that sound like something your team needs?

## Getting personal

I've built and led both large and small content teams, developing a knack for relating to people, regardless of their background or experience level.

Mentoring is delivered in two ways:

- **1:1 Catchup** - An informal chat giving individuals the opportunity to explore each aspect of their role. From activities they've been proud of to the areas they're struggling with, they'll return to work enthused, more confident and more capable.
- **Group Sessions** - For teams of between two and five people who work together on content projects. I'll help them become a closer-knit, more effective unit that's able to make the most out of the unique skills of each individual. 

Mentoring works best delivered monthly or quarterly but can be at whatever interval you'd prefer. Discussions are confidential, but you'll receive a summary after each session outlining a few key points.

If you'd like to find out the related costs or have an alternative mentoring requirement, [give me a call](/contact).
