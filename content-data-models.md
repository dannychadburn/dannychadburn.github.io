# Digging into the data

#### Data is the last basion of the content industry. We all know it's important, but few businesses have developed a solid structure for establishing whether what they're doing works.

When you've looked after as many [content campaigns](/creative-content-campaigns) as I have, you're bound to pick up knowledge of how to report on their success. I help businesses develop data frameworks and dashboards. They're quick to construct, simple to understand and seamless to share with colleagues, clients or your big bosses.

This isn't about yet another expensive tool or ripping up what you're doing - it's about a better, move valuable interpretation of data you're probably already collecting.

## My services come in two flavours:

- **Data Setup** - A four to six week consultancy where I integrate myself into your organisation. I'll compile, combine and automate various data sources into a structure that makes essential insight immediately available.
- **Data Workshops** - A series of hands on sessions with the people across your business who need to know about data. These can be full or half day, depending on the size of your company and the complexity of your analytics setup.

Does that sound like something you need?

## Dashboards anyone can understand

Your content operation might consist of PR, SEO, social media, editorial and marketing teams all working on similar activities. However, they'll all have their own targets, and will inevitablly be tracking different aspects in different ways. All this disperate information will also probably contradict what your ecommerce team has say.

A centralised (but customisible) view of data is essential so they each understand the consequences of their actions. 

If you've pondered on any of the following questions, it might be worth [getting in touch](/contact) to discuss how I can help.

- How do you assess content ROI when there's no direct revenue?
- How do you compare various campaigns on an even keel?
- Why does it take so much time to create post-campaign reports?
- Why do our senior managers always question the validity of our data?

## The tools of my trade

There are hundreds of analytics software packages out there, each with their own quirks and foibles. Fortunately, I've dabbled with the majority and can advise you on how to get the most out of:

- Google Analytics / Adwords / Data Studio
- Adobe Analytics
- Microsoft Power BI
- Tableau
- Kissmetrics
- Brandwatch / Hootsuite
- Ahrefs / SEMrush

This is a far from exclusive list, and I'm happy to tackle any tool you use - [give me a call](/contact) and we can discuss your project.
