# Beers for Ideas

#### My mind is always wirring, churning out far more ideas than I could ever turn into reality.

Rather than letting them go to waste, I can send you an idea tailored for your company, in exchange for some delicious craft brews.

Need an fresh content idea to pitch to a client? Seeking an inventive way of advertising your new product? Trying to get your startup in the eyes of potential customers? Off to a job interview and want to differentiate yourself?

## A little more lubrication, a little more traction

Ideas are delivered within **72 days** and the exchange rate is **£25** (approx. $36 or €29) - the cost a delicious [Craft Beer Box](https://www.flavourly.com/beer/club/).

For that you will get:

- A few paragraphs summarising the overall concept
- An examples of how it may look and where it could be used

> I also offer a fully formed [creative content campaign](/creative-content-marketing) service (with optional beer).
