# Beers for Ideas

#### My mind is always wirring, churning out far more ideas than I could ever turn into reality.

Rather than letting them go to waste, I can send you an idea tailored for your company, in exchange for some delicious craft brews.

Need an exciting content idea to pitch to a client? Seeking an inventive way of advertising your new product? Trying to get your startup in the eyes of potential customers? Off to a job interview and want to differentiate yourself?

You've come to the right place.

## A little more lubrication, a little more action

Ideas are delivered in **3 days** and the exchange rate is a one month [flavourly.com Craft Beer Club](https://www.flavourly.com/beer/club/) subscription - **£25** (approx. $36 or €29).

For that you will get:

- A few paragraphs summarising the overall concept
- A rough sketch of how it could look
- Examples of how, where and when it could be implemented

> I also offer a fully formed [creative content campaign](/creative-content-campaigns) service (minus the beer).
