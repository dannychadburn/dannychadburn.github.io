  <div class="contactContent">
    <p class="intro">My mind is a conveyor belt of creativity, churning out far more ideas than I could ever turn into reality.</p>
    <p>Rather than letting them go to waste, I can send you an idea tailored for your company, in exchange for some lovely ales.</p>
    <p>Need an exciting content idea to pitch to a client? Need an inventive way of advertising your new product? Off to a job interview and want to differentiate yourself? You've come to the right place.</p>
      <h3>What you get</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A couple of paragraphs summarising the overall concept</li>
      <li>A rought sketch of how it could look</li>
      <li>A few examples of how, where and when it could be implemented</li>
    </ul>   
    <p>If you want a full formed <a href="/creative-content-campaign">creative content campaign plan</a> minus the beer, I offer that too.</p>
  </div>
  <h3>Ideas delivered within three days</h3>
  <p>The exchange rate is a one month <a href="http://flavourly.com/DANNYKZXW">flavourly.com</a> Craft Beer Club subscription - <b>£25</b> (approx. $36 or €29).</p>
