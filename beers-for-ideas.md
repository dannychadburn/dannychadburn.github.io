# Beers for Ideas

My mind is a conveyor belt of creativity, churning out far more ideas than I could ever turn into reality.

Rather than letting them go to waste, I can send you an idea tailored for your company, in exchange for some lovely ales.

> Need an exciting content idea to pitch to a client? Need an inventive way of advertising your new product? Off to a job interview and want to differentiate yourself? You've come to the right place.

## What you get

- A couple of paragraphs summarising the overall concept
- A rought sketch of how it could look
- A few examples of how, where and when it could be implemented

[See an example idea](#)

If you want a fully formed [creative content campaign](/creative-content-campaign) plan minus the beer, I offer that too.

## Ideas delivered within three days</h3>

The exchange rate is a one month [flavourly.com Craft Beer Club](http://flavourly.com/DANNYKZXW) subscription - £25 (approx. $36 or €29).
